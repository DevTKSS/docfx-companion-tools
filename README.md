# DocFX Companion Tools

This repository contains a series of tools, templates, tips and tricks to make your DocFX life even better. You will find the following elements in this repository:

* [TocDocFxCreation](./TocDocFxCreation): an advance tool to create automatically Table of Content in Yaml format for DocFX. It has cool features like ability to support order of files, using the real main level title in the files themselves for the TOC name entry, override possibility per folder for those titles and more!
* [DocLinkChecker](./DocLinkChecker): a tool to check and clean a `.attachments` folder where all attachments should be stored, inspect the links in all the files and make sure they either point in an existing file either rases a warning. And it has the ability to automatically clean the folder! Very handy in pipelines as well!
