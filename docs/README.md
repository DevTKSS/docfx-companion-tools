# DocFx Companion Tools

The **DocFx Companion Tools** can be used as an addition to [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) for publishing a documentation website. Some of the tools are also useful if you are using another documentation platform like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/),  [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify) or others. And even if you don't generate and documentation website but just want to validate documentation, there are tools in this toolset that can be used.
